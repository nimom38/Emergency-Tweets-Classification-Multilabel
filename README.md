Of these 24 categories, 6 of them(written in bold) are actionable categories that needs immediate attention by the emergency response officers.

We have experimented with 5 statistical classifiers. They are-

1. Multinomial Naive Bayes
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest

We have also experimented with 1 neural network (Multilayer Perceptron)
